We've created a `hotel` SQL database that has tables part of a _hotel-management_ application.

`USE` the `hotel` database and display its tables: 

```

```

The `guests` table needs some data to be deleted because guests check-in and check-out from the hotel in short periods of time.

Let's inspect the data from the `guests` table by doing a `SELECT * FROM guests;`:

```

```

In the next section, we'll apply the `DELETE` statement to some of the `guests` table data.
